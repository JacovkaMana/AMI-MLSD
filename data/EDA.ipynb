       "  'description': 'The characters must rescue one or more kidnapped NPCs, probably\\n      from the stronghold of the kidnapper. Obviously, they must get to\\n      said stronghold, break in, rescue the kidnappee, break out, and\\n      escape back to safety; this usually requires careful and clever\\n      planning and a large dose of luck.'},\n",

In it, the heros are given (or\\n      undertake) a task to perform: The taking of a city, the rescue of\\n      an innocent, the destruction of a monster, the creation of a\\n      magical item, the defeat of a Master Villain, etc. But the path\\n      to victory is not a simple one. To get to their goal, Event A,\\n      they find that they must first accomplish some other task --\\n      Event B. But when they undertake the task of accomplishing Event\\n      B, they find that they must first accomplish Event C. This goes\\n      on for several encounters, until the heroes accomplish all the\\n      obstacle events which prevent them from returning to Event A,\\n      their original goal.'},\n",

You can separate them by having traps and tricks break\\n      the party apart, by having them see two or three things they must\\n      resolve (such as danger to innocents or the appearance of minion\\n      villains) pop up simultaneously; they'll have to run in all\\n      directions at the same time or suffer failure. Once the party is\\n      broken down into bite-sized chunks, you confront each individual\\n      or small group with the enemy or enemies he most deserves to face\\n      -- his personal enemy, the monster which defeated him before,\\n      etc. -- for a grand series of climactic duels.\"},\n",

Often, the Rogue will not be behind the\\n      nastiness the heroes are encountering; he may be in competition\\n      with them for the prize they're seeking. Often the heroes and the\\n      Rogue (and his minions) will have to team up to succeed at their\\n      task. Just as often, the Rogue will try to get away with the\\n      whole treasure.\"},\n",

In this chase, the heroes and villains are pursuing\\n      one another across a lot of territory and they're not catching up\\n      with one another very fast.

Just as appropriately, this long-dead\\n      nobleman may have died after making some important choice -- such\\n      as choosing love over career or career over friends; and the\\n      choice he faced is identical to the one the hero now faces.
